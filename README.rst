Matchms is an open-source Python package to import, process, clean, and compare mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). It allows to implement and run an easy-to-follow, easy-to-reproduce workflow from raw mass spectra to pre- and post-processed spectral data. Spectral data can be imported from common formats such mzML, mzXML, msp, metabolomics-USI, MGF, or json (e.g. GNPS-syle json files). Matchms then provides filters for metadata cleaning and checking, as well as for basic peak filtering. Finally, matchms was build to import and apply different similarity measures to compare large amounts of spectra. This includes common Cosine scores, but can also easily be extended by custom measures. Example for spectrum similarity measures that were designed to work in matchms are `Spec2Vec <https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec>`_ and `MS2DeepScore <https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore>`_.

**********************************
Latest changes (matchms >= 0.18.0)
**********************************

Pipeline class
==============

To make typical matchms workflows (data import, processing, score computations) more accessible to users, matchms now offers a `Pipeline` class to handle complex workflows. This also allows to define, import, export, or modify workflows using yaml files. See code examples below (and soon: updated tutorial).

Sparse scores array
===================

We realized that many matchms-based workflows aim to compare many-to-many spectra whereby not all pairs and scores are equally important. Often, for instance, it will be about searching similar or related spectra/compounds. This also means that often not all scores need to be stored (or computed). For this reason we now shifted to a sparse handling of scores in matchms (that means: only storing actuallly computed, non-null values).

**********************************
Latest changes (matchms >= 0.14.0)
**********************************

Metadata class
==============

This is the first of a few releases to work our way towards matchms 1.0.0, which also means that a few things in the API will likely change. Here the main change is that `Spectrum.metadata` is no longer a simple Python dictionary but became a ``Metadata`` object. In this context metadata field-names/keys will now be harmonized by default (e.g. "Precursor Mass" will become "precursor_mz). For list of conversions see `matchms key conversion table <https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv>`_.

- metadata is now stored using new ``Metadata`` class which automatically applied restrictions to used field names/keys to avoid confusion between different format styles
- all metadata keys must be lower-case, spaces will be changed to underscores.
- Known key conversions are applied to metadata entries using a `matchms key conversion table <https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv>`_.
- new ``MetadataMatch`` similarity measure in matchms.similarity. This can be used to find matches between metadata entries and currently supports either full string matches or matches of numerical entries within a specified tolerance
- new ``interpret_pepmass()`` filter to handle different pepmass entries found in data 
- ``Spikes`` class has become ``Fragments`` class

Documentation for users
***********************
For more extensive documentation `see our readthedocs <https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and our `matchms introduction tutorial <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee>`_.

Installation
============

Prerequisites:  

- Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10, (higher versions should work as well, but are not yet tested systematically)
- Anaconda (recommended)

We recommend installing matchms in a new virtual environment to avoid dependency clashes

.. code-block:: console

  conda create --name matchms python=3.9
  conda activate matchms
  conda install --channel bioconda --channel conda-forge matchms

Alternatively, matchms can also be installed using ``pip``. In the most basic version matchms will then come without ``rdkit`` so that several filter functions related to processing and cleaning chemical metadata will not run. To include ``rdkit`` install matchms as ``matchms[chemistry]``:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install matchms  # simple install w/o rdkit
  pip install matchms[chemistry]  # full install including rdkit

matchms ecosystem -> additional functionalities
===============================================

Matchms functionalities can be complemented by additional packages.  
To date we are aware of:

+ `Spec2Vec <https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec>`_ an alternative machine-learning spectral similarity score that can simply be installed by `pip install spec2vec` and be imported as `from spec2vec import Spec2Vec` following the same API as the scores in `matchms.similarity`.

+ `MS2DeepScore <https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore>`_ a supervised, deep-learning based spectral similarity score that can simply be installed by `pip install ms2deepscore` and be imported as `from ms2deepscore import MS2DeepScore` following the same API as the scores in `matchms.similarity`.

+ `matchmsextras <https://github.com/matchms/matchmsextras>`_ which contains additional functions to create networks based on spectral similarities, to run spectrum searchers against `PubChem`, or additional plotting methods.

+ `memo <https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/memo>`_ a method allowing a Retention Time (RT) agnostic alignment of metabolomics samples using the fragmentation spectra (MS2) of their consituents.

*(if you know of any other packages that are fully compatible with matchms, let us know!)*

Introduction
============

To get started with matchms, we recommend following our `matchms introduction tutorial <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee>`_.

Below is a small example of using matchms to calculate the Cosine score between mass Spectrums in the `tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf <https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf>`_ file.

.. code-block:: python

    from matchms import Pipeline
    
    pipeline = Pipeline()
    
    # Read spectrums from a MGF formatted file, for other formats see https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.importing.html 
    pipeline.query_files = "tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf"
    pipeline.filter_steps_queries = [
        ["default_filters"],
        ["add_parent_mass"],
        ["normalize_intensities"],
        ["select_by_intensity", {"intensity_from": 0.001, "intensity_to": 1.0}],
        ["select_by_mz", {"mz_from": 0, "mz_to": 1000}],
        ["require_minimum_number_of_peaks", {"n_required": 5}]
    ]
    pipeline.score_computations = [["precursormzmatch",  {"tolerance": 100.0}],
                                   ["cosinegreedy", {"tolerance": 1.0}],
                                   ["filter_by_range", {"name": "CosineGreedy_score", "low": 0.2}]]

    pipeline.logging_file = "my_pipeline.log"  # for pipeline and logging message
    pipeline.logging_level = "INFO"
    pipeline.run()


Alternatively, in particular if you need more room to add custom functions and steps, the individual
steps can run without using the matchms ``Pipeline``:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from matchms.importing import load_from_mgf
    from matchms.filtering import default_filters, normalize_intensities
    from matchms import calculate_scores
    from matchms.similarity import CosineGreedy

    # Read spectrums from a MGF formatted file, for other formats see https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.importing.html 
    file = load_from_mgf("tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf")

    # Apply filters to clean and enhance each spectrum
    spectrums = []
    for spectrum in file:
        # Apply default filter to standardize ion mode, correct charge and more.
        # Default filter is fully explained at https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.filtering.html .
        spectrum = default_filters(spectrum)
        # Scale peak intensities to maximum of 1
        spectrum = normalize_intensities(spectrum)
        spectrums.append(spectrum)

    # Calculate Cosine similarity scores between all spectrums
    # For other similarity score methods see https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.similarity.html .
    scores = calculate_scores(references=spectrums,
                              queries=spectrums,
                              similarity_function=CosineGreedy())

    # Matchms allows to get the best matches for any query using scores_by_query
    query = spectrums[15]  # just an example
    best_matches = scores.scores_by_query(query, 'CosineGreedy_score', sort=True)

    # Print the calculated scores for each spectrum pair
    for (reference, score) in best_matches[:10]
        # Ignore scores between same spectrum
        if reference is not query:
            print(f"Reference scan id: {reference.metadata['scans']}")
            print(f"Query scan id: {query.metadata['scans']}")
            print(f"Score: {score[0]:.4f}")
            print(f"Number of matching peaks: {score[1]}")
            print("----------------------------")

Different spectrum similarity scores
====================================

Matchms comes with numerous different scoring methods in `matchms.similarity` and can furthe seemlessly work with `Spec2Vec` or `MS2DeepScore`.

Code example: 

.. code-block:: python

    from matchms.importing import load_from_usi
    import matchms.filtering as msfilters
    import matchms.similarity as mssim


    usi1 = "mzspec:GNPS:GNPS-LIBRARY:accession:CCMSLIB00000424840"
    usi2 = "mzspec:MSV000086109:BD5_dil2x_BD5_01_57213:scan:760"

    mz_tolerance = 0.1

    spectrum1 = load_from_usi(usi1)
    spectrum1 = msfilters.select_by_mz(spectrum1, 0, spectrum1.get("precursor_mz"))
    spectrum1 = msfilters.remove_peaks_around_precursor_mz(spectrum1,
                                                           mz_tolerance=0.1)

    spectrum2 = load_from_usi(usi2)
    spectrum2 = msfilters.select_by_mz(spectrum2, 0, spectrum1.get("precursor_mz"))
    spectrum2 = msfilters.remove_peaks_around_precursor_mz(spectrum2,
                                                           mz_tolerance=0.1)
    # Compute scores:
    similarity_cosine = mssim.CosineGreedy(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)
    similarity_modified_cosine = mssim.ModifiedCosine(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)
    similarity_neutral_losses = mssim.NeutralLossesCosine(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)

    print(f"similarity_cosine: {similarity_cosine}")
    print(f"similarity_modified_cosine: {similarity_modified_cosine}")
    print(f"similarity_neutral_losses: {similarity_neutral_losses}")

    spectrum1.plot_against(spectrum2)
