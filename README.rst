Matchms is a versatile open-source Python package developed for importing, processing, cleaning, and comparing mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). It facilitates the implementation of straightforward, reproducible workflows, transforming raw data from common mass spectra file formats into pre- and post-processed spectral data, and enabling large-scale spectral similarity comparisons.

The software supports a range of popular spectral data formats, including mzML, mzXML, msp, metabolomics-USI, MGF, and JSON. Matchms offers an array of tools for metadata cleaning and validation, alongside basic peak filtering, to ensure data accuracy and integrity. A key feature of matchms is its ability to apply various pairwise similarity measures for comparing extensive amounts of spectra. This encompasses not only common Cosine-related scores but also molecular fingerprint-based comparisons and other metadata-related assessments.

One of the strengths of matchms is its extensibility, allowing users to integrate custom similarity measures. Notable examples of spectrum similarity measures tailored for Matchms include `Spec2Vec <https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec>`_ and `MS2DeepScore <https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore>`_. Additionally, Matchms enhances efficiency by using faster similarity measures for initial pre-selection and supports storing results in sparse data formats, enabling the comparison of several hundred thousands of spectra. This combination of features positions Matchms as a comprehensive tool for mass spectrometry data analysis.

**********************************
Latest changes (matchms >= 0.18.0)
**********************************

Pipeline class
==============

To make typical matchms workflows (data import, processing, score computations) more accessible to users, matchms now offers a `Pipeline` class to handle complex workflows. This also allows to create, import, export, or modify workflows using yaml files. See code examples below (and soon: updated tutorial).

Sparse scores array
===================

We realized that many matchms-based workflows aim to compare many-to-many spectra whereby not all pairs and scores are equally important. Often, for instance, it will be about searching similar or related spectra/compounds. This also means that often not all scores need to be stored (or computed). For this reason, we now shifted to a sparse handling of scores in matchms (that means: only storing actually computed, non-null values).

***********************
Documentation for users
***********************
For more extensive documentation `see our readthedocs <https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and our `matchms introduction tutorial <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee>`_.

Installation
============

Prerequisites:  

- Python 3.8 - 3.11, (higher versions should work as well, but are not yet tested systematically)
- Anaconda (recommended)

We recommend installing matchms in a new virtual environment to avoid dependency clashes

.. code-block:: console

  conda create --name matchms python=3.9
  conda activate matchms
  conda install --channel bioconda --channel conda-forge matchms

Alternatively, matchms can also be installed using ``pip``. In the most basic version matchms will then come without ``rdkit`` so that several filter functions related to processing and cleaning chemical metadata will not run. To include ``rdkit`` install matchms as ``matchms[chemistry]``:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install matchms  # simple install w/o rdkit
  pip install matchms[chemistry]  # full install including rdkit

matchms ecosystem -> additional functionalities
===============================================

Matchms functionalities can be complemented by additional packages.  
To date, we are aware of:

+ `Spec2Vec <https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec>`_ an alternative machine-learning spectral similarity score that can simply be installed by `pip install spec2vec` and be imported as `from spec2vec import Spec2Vec` following the same API as the scores in `matchms.similarity`.

+ `MS2DeepScore <https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore>`_ a supervised, deep-learning based spectral similarity score that can simply be installed by `pip install ms2deepscore` and be imported as `from ms2deepscore import MS2DeepScore` following the same API as the scores in `matchms.similarity`.

+ `matchmsextras <https://github.com/matchms/matchmsextras>`_ which contains additional functions to create networks based on spectral similarities, to run spectrum searchers against `PubChem`, or additional plotting methods.

+ `MS2Query <https://github.com/iomega/ms2query>`_ Reliable and fast MS/MS spectral-based analogue search, running on top of matchms.

+ `memo <https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/memo>`_ a method allowing a Retention Time (RT) agnostic alignment of metabolomics samples using the fragmentation spectra (MS2) of their constituents.

+ `RIAssigner <https://github.com/RECETOX/RIAssigner>`_ a tool for retention index calculation for gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data.

+ `MSMetaEnhancer <https://github.com/RECETOX/MSMetaEnhancer>`_ is a python package to collect mass spectral library metadata using various web services and computational chemistry packages.

+ `cudams <https://github.com/tornikeo/cudams>`_ is a python package for fast similarity calculations, using GPU's to speed up the cosine score calculations by 100-500x compared to the standard matchms implementation. 

*(if you know of any other packages that are fully compatible with matchms, let us know!)*

Introduction
============

To get started with matchms, we recommend following our `matchms introduction tutorial <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee>`_.

Below is an example of using default filter steps for cleaning spectra, 
followed by calculating the Cosine score between mass Spectrums in the `tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf <https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf>`_ file.

.. code-block:: python

    from matchms.Pipeline import Pipeline, create_workflow

    workflow = create_workflow(
        yaml_file_name="my_config_file.yaml", # The workflow will be stored in a yaml file, this can be used to rerun your workflow or to share it with others.
        score_computations=[["cosinegreedy", {"tolerance": 1.0}]],
        )
    pipeline = Pipeline(workflow)
    pipeline.logging_file = "my_pipeline.log"  # for pipeline and logging message
    pipeline.run("tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf")
    
Below is a more advanced code example showing how you can make a specific pipeline for your needs.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from matchms.Pipeline import Pipeline, create_workflow
    from matchms.filtering.default_pipelines import DEFAULT_FILTERS, LIBRARY_CLEANING
    
    results_folder = "./results"
    os.makedirs(results_folder, exist_ok=True)
    
    workflow = create_workflow(
        yaml_file_name=os.path.join(results_folder, "my_config_file.yaml"),  # The workflow will be stored in a yaml file.
        query_filters=DEFAULT_FILTERS,
        reference_filters=LIBRARY_CLEANING + ["add_fingerprint"],
        score_computations=[["precursormzmatch", {"tolerance": 100.0}],
                            ["cosinegreedy", {"tolerance": 1.0}],
                            ["filter_by_range", {"name": "CosineGreedy_score", "low": 0.2}]],
    )
    pipeline = Pipeline(workflow)
    pipeline.logging_file = os.path.join(results_folder, "my_pipeline.log")  # for pipeline and logging message
    pipeline.logging_level = "WARNING"  # To define the verbosety of the logging
    pipeline.run("tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf", "my_reference_library.mgf",
                 cleaned_query_file=os.path.join(results_folder, "cleaned_query_spectra.mgf"),
                 cleaned_reference_file=os.path.join(results_folder,
                                                     "cleaned_library_spectra.mgf"))  # choose your own files


Alternatively, in particular, if you need more room to add custom functions and steps, the individual steps can run without using the matchms ``Pipeline``:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from matchms.importing import load_from_mgf
    from matchms.filtering import default_filters, normalize_intensities
    from matchms import calculate_scores
    from matchms.similarity import CosineGreedy

    # Read spectrums from a MGF formatted file, for other formats see https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.importing.html 
    file = load_from_mgf("tests/testdata/pesticides.mgf")

    # Apply filters to clean and enhance each spectrum
    spectrums = []
    for spectrum in file:
        # Apply default filter to standardize ion mode, correct charge and more.
        # Default filter is fully explained at https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.filtering.html .
        spectrum = default_filters(spectrum)
        # Scale peak intensities to maximum of 1
        spectrum = normalize_intensities(spectrum)
        spectrums.append(spectrum)

    # Calculate Cosine similarity scores between all spectrums
    # For other similarity score methods see https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.similarity.html .
    scores = calculate_scores(references=spectrums,
                              queries=spectrums,
                              similarity_function=CosineGreedy())

    # Matchms allows to get the best matches for any query using scores_by_query
    query = spectrums[15]  # just an example
    best_matches = scores.scores_by_query(query, 'CosineGreedy_score', sort=True)

    # Print the calculated scores for each spectrum pair
    for (reference, score) in best_matches[:10]:
        # Ignore scores between same spectra
        if reference is not query:
            print(f"Reference scan id: {reference.metadata['scans']}")
            print(f"Query scan id: {query.metadata['scans']}")
            print(f"Score: {score[0]:.4f}")
            print(f"Number of matching peaks: {score[1]}")
            print("----------------------------")


Different spectrum similarity scores
====================================

Matchms comes with numerous different scoring methods in `matchms.similarity` and can further seamlessly work with `Spec2Vec` or `MS2DeepScore`.

Code example: 

.. code-block:: python

    from matchms.importing import load_from_usi
    import matchms.filtering as msfilters
    import matchms.similarity as mssim


    usi1 = "mzspec:GNPS:GNPS-LIBRARY:accession:CCMSLIB00000424840"
    usi2 = "mzspec:MSV000086109:BD5_dil2x_BD5_01_57213:scan:760"

    mz_tolerance = 0.1

    spectrum1 = load_from_usi(usi1)
    spectrum1 = msfilters.select_by_mz(spectrum1, 0, spectrum1.get("precursor_mz"))
    spectrum1 = msfilters.remove_peaks_around_precursor_mz(spectrum1,
                                                           mz_tolerance=0.1)

    spectrum2 = load_from_usi(usi2)
    spectrum2 = msfilters.select_by_mz(spectrum2, 0, spectrum1.get("precursor_mz"))
    spectrum2 = msfilters.remove_peaks_around_precursor_mz(spectrum2,
                                                           mz_tolerance=0.1)
    # Compute scores:
    similarity_cosine = mssim.CosineGreedy(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)
    similarity_modified_cosine = mssim.ModifiedCosine(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)
    similarity_neutral_losses = mssim.NeutralLossesCosine(tolerance=mz_tolerance).pair(spectrum1, spectrum2)

    print(f"similarity_cosine: {similarity_cosine}")
    print(f"similarity_modified_cosine: {similarity_modified_cosine}")
    print(f"similarity_neutral_losses: {similarity_neutral_losses}")

    spectrum1.plot_against(spectrum2)
