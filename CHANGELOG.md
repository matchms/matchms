The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Added

### changed
- Removed repair_precursor_is_parent_mass
- repair_adduct_based_on_smiles does not repair adducts [M]+ and [M]- anymore, since these cases could also be due to a mistake in filling in the parent mass instead of the precursor mz. 
- repair_parent_mass_is_molar_weight does only repair parent mass and does not change the precursor mz.
- Change repair_parent_mass_is_mol_wt to repair_parent_mass_is_molar_mass
- Set RDKIT version to rdkit = ">=2023.3.2,<2023.9.5" to fix installation issues.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-01-05

### Added

- new `Pipeline` class to define entire matchms workflows. This includes importing one or several datasets, processing using matchms filtering/processing functions as well as similartiy computations. Also allows to import/export workflows as yaml files.

### Changed

- major change of `Scores` class. Internally, scores are now stored as a stacked sparse array. This allows to store several different scores for spectrum-spectrums pairs in an efficient way. Also makes it possible to run large-scale comparisons in particular when pipelines start with rapid selective similarity scoring methods such as MetadataMatch or PrecursorMzMatch.
- Scoring/similarity methods now also get a `.sparse_array()` method (next to the previous `.pair()` and `.matrix()` methods).

### Fixed

- minor fix in `interpret_pepmass` function.

## [0.17.0] - 2022-08-23

### Added
- `Scores`: added functionality for writing and reading `Scores` objects to/from disk as JSON and Pickle files [#353](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/353)

### Added

- `SimilarityNetwork`: similarity-network graphs can now be exported to [cyjs](http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/index.html),
[gexf](http://gexf.net/schema.html), [gml](https://web.archive.org/web/20190207140002/http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/index.php?id=17297&L=1),
and node-link JSON formats [#349](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/349)

### Changed
- metadata filtering: made prefilter check for SMILES and InChI more lenient, eventually resulting in longer runtimes but more accurate checks [#337](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/337)

## [0.15.0] - 2022-03-09

Added neutral losses similarity score (cosine-type score) and a few small fixes.

### Added

- new spectral similarity score: `NeutralLossesCosine` which is based on matches between neutral losses of two spectra [#329](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/329)

- added key conversion: "rtinseconds" to "retention_time" [#331](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/331)

### Fixed

- handling of duplicate entries in spectrum files (e.g. as field and again in the comments field in msp files) by ugrade of pickydict to 0.4.0 [#332](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/332)

## [0.14.0] - 2022-02-18

This is the first of a few releases to work our way towards matchms 1.0.0, which also means that a few things in the API will likely change. Here the main change is that `Spectrum.metadata` is no longer a simple Python dictionary but became a `Metadata` object. In this context metadata field-names/keys will now be harmonized by default (e.g. "Precursor Mass" will become "precursor_mz). For list of conversions see [matchms key conversion table](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/development/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv).

### Added

- new `MetadataMatch`similarity measure in matchms.similarity. This can be used to find matches between metadata entries and currently supports either full string matches or matches of numerical entries within a specified tolerance [#315](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/315)
- metadata is now stored using new `Metadata` class which automatically applied restrictions to used field names/keys to avoid confusion between different format styles [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)
- all metadata keys must be lower-case, spaces will be changed to underscores.
- Known key conversions are applied to metadata entries using a [matchms key conversion table](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/development/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv)
- new `interpret_pepmass()` filter to handle different pepmass entries found in data [#298][https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/298] 

### Changed

- Metadata harmonization will now happen by default! This includes changing field name style and applying known key conversions. To avoid the key conversions user have to make this explicit by setting `metadata_harmonization=False` [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)
- `Spikes` class has become `Fragments` class [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)
- Change import style (now: isort 5 and slightly different style) [#323](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/323)

### Fixed

- can now handle charges that come as a string of type "2+" or "1-" [#301](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/301)

## [0.12.0] - 2022-01-18

### Added
