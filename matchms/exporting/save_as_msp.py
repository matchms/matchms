    Parameters
    ----------
    spectrums:
        Expected input are match.Spectrum.Spectrum() objects.
    filename:
        Provide filename to save spectrum(s).
    write_peak_comments:
        Writes peak comments to individual peaks after the respective mz/intensity pair
        when set to True. Default is True.
    mode:
        Mode on how to write to file. One of ["w", "a"] (write/append). Default is append.
    style:
        Converts the keys to required Export style. One of ["massbank", "nist", "riken", "gnps"].
        Default is "matchms"
